## Questions

1. Why does your program need a setup and a loop?

    Programs need a setup to initialize ports and variables, and a loop is used to execute the functions required. 

2. What is the downside to putting all your code in a loop?

    You have to ensure that your loop is infinite when necessary, and ends at the correct condition when it is not an infinite loop. 

3. Why does your code need to be compiled?

    The compiler works as a type of translator, to change the code in C to machine code, so the computer can understand the programmer. 

4. When lowering the frequency in procedure A, step 4, what is going wrong? Brainstorm some solutions. Dimmers exist in the real world. What is their solution?
